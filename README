The library cudapp is the basis of SimplePyCuda, a simple wrapper for CUDA functions in Python.
The idea is to workaround the issues regarding Context in old CUDA versions, that persist on PyCuda.

Usage:

"make [all]" will build the lib cudapp.so

"make run" will execute "testSimplePyCuda.py", using library "simplepycuda.py".
